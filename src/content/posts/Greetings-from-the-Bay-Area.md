Hi friends!

It's been a hot minute. I promise I didn't abandon this blog, but I've been busy in my own personal life. In an exciting development, I'm finally in the Bay Area! I made the move out here to San Francisco with my current company last month and have gotten all settled in. 

I'm excited. If you know me, you know I've been trying to do this for a while. And now it's here. Honestly, it's surreal. I keep almost needing to pinch myself because it almost seems like a dream.

But we're here. I'm moved in, I'm pumped, I'm inspired to build, write and grow. And you best believe it'll happen.

Talk soon!
