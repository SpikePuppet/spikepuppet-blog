# About Me

My name is Rhys Johns, and I'm a software engineer from Sydney, Australia. I love all things tech, and spend a lot of time thinking about how to make things with code. I know that sounds quite broad - and it's meant too! I love diving into anything I can!

I've spent the bulk of my career in startups and spend way to much time thinking about them, and I'm hoping one day to get to work in the Bay Area and do stuff with  startups there. I do also have a background in games development too! Which I'm always happy to talk about

Outside of tech, I love video games, martial arts (both training and teaching), hitting the gym and anything nerdy. I've also, since about 2024 developed a love for the American Football and Baseball!

If you want to reach me,feel free to hit me up through the links on my page. And feel free to subscribe to my RSS feed to keep up with my ramblings.

Thanks!
