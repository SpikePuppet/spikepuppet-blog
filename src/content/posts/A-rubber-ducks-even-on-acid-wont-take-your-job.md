I still remember pretty clearly. It was 2011, and I was sitting in my Certificate IV in Programming course (or it might have been the start of a diploma, but either was it was early in my education), and we we're doing our "Project Management" unit. It wasn't the worst class, and we had a great teacher, who's name I wish I still remembered. But one day he turned to us, fresh blood in the world of tech and told us point blank "You won't have jobs in a few years".

I remember being baffled? What did he mean? Why the hell were we doing this course. He went on to elaborate that all the programming jobs would be outsourced to other countries, and we wouldn't need to write code. I pushed it to the back of my mind, determined to write some code and find the challenge I was looking for (a recurring theme which would guide the bulk of my career). 

Jump to a few years later, the startup revolution back by zero interest rates was in full swing. And wouldn't you know it, he was wrong. We were very much needed. This pattern would continue throughout my career - there was no code, then outsourcing again, and each time we were told "You won't have a job", and each time we were needed even more. 

As software engineers, this is something we hear every few years, and this AI revolution is no different. AI - by this I mean our current iteration using LLM's - is such a powerful tool. I often like to refer to it as a Rubber Duck on Acid. Often times when I'm stuck I'll whack what I'm up against into the LLM, and watch what comes out. If it's gibberish, usually that jogs something to help me get out of my funk. If it's good, it launches me into a flow state where all kinds of work gets done. 

I also rely heavily on AI dev tools in my day job (I have very strict rules for myself using it at home on personal projects, or when learning something, which I think I'll include in a future post) and they can do amazing things. I often use an approach called the "Gold Master approach", where I'll take a PR that has established a pattern, turn it into a git patch and then direct the LLM to implement something using that, to amazing results. As a side note, big shout out to Sourcegraph Amp - far an away that's the best one I've used thus far.

But they're exactly that - tools. Tools for you, as the software engineer, to use and apply as needed. AI can gather a lot of context, and it's a sight to behold. But AI will tell you what it thinks you want to hear. This works great for boiler plate code, or patterns you've written a thousand times in your codebase,
