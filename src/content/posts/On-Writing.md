In the age of LLM's, it's easy to churn out content. Polished, refined, an able to replicate anything it's been exposed too, it's never been easier to churn out a polished blog post or report. 

It's that exact reason that on this blog, when it comes to writing these blog posts I avoid using LLM's. I like to send my posts, with all it's grammatical strangeness and random typos that need to be corrected after the fact, out into the ether of the internet for you all to see. I avoid using LLM's for this purpose to ensure my voice remains mine. To ensure that what you're reading is conveyed in how I would actually tell you something.

But I also do it to crystalize my own thoughts, to work through what I'm thinking and work on how I communicate that. I do it to learn new topics - you learn so much more when you have to write about it after the fact so you can teach someone. 

I do it, so that in the age of LLMs, I can speak directly to folks. And if I can even speak to just one person, in my own voice, then it was all worth it!
